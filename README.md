# IllusiveBot
A discord bot made to interact with the [Illusive](https://github.com/pippinmole/Illusive) API.

## Disclaimer
I made this project back in early 2020. I have no plans on maintaining it, just uploaded it here for archival purposes.

## Building and Running
> **presumptions**: you have git and node properly installed and added to your `path`.   

To build from source, clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/ibra/IllusiveBot
```
Then run:
```
npm install
```
And finally create a local instance of the bot.:
```
node .
```
